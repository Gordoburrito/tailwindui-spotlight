We're growing - looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our team in New York or San Francisco bay area. 

We're looking for a senior engineer who excels at working autonomously and makes smart technical tradeoffs. If you enjoy working on hard problems, send me a note. Experience with 3D renderings a huge plus.
