Hi Gordon!
I am looking forward to our chat. 

Let me share a bit ahead of our meeting. 

https://www.propheticsoftware.ai/
Full Stack Engineer

Prophetic is an early stage, fast growing company building a live platform that real customers depend on. The product is actively evolving, the surface area is expanding, and the team is scaling quickly.

This is a true build while flying environment. Priorities shift as new customers come on. Ownership is not always neatly scoped. Success often looks like stepping in to do what is most needed in the moment whether that is building, fixing, iterating, or unblocking others.

We are looking for a Full Stack Engineer who is energized by that kind of environment and who stays effective even when they do not fully control technical direction.


What you’ll work on

You will help build and evolve a production platform used by real customers today. The work spans backend systems, data heavy workflows, and user facing product surfaces. As the product evolves, so will the problems you are solving.

Day to day, that means:

• Building and iterating on full stack features end to end
• Working across backend, frontend, and data related concerns as needed
• Adapting to changing requirements as customer needs evolve
• Shipping incrementally, learning from usage, and refining over time
• Helping shape systems and patterns as the platform grows
• Stepping in where the team needs you most rather than staying in a fixed lane

This is not a role where everything is fully specced upfront. You will often be working with partial context and helping define the path forward as you build.


How the team works

The team values momentum, pragmatism, and emotional steadiness.

Engineers here are expected to execute well even when they do not fully control technical direction. That means being able to take some psychological distance from the work, release control when needed, and stay engaged and effective through ambiguity, tradeoffs, and iteration.

You will work closely with other engineers and product partners in an environment where feedback comes from real usage and real customers, not just tickets or specs.


What they're looking for

We are intentionally not hiring for a specific framework or stack.

Instead, we are looking for someone who brings:

• Full stack experience and comfort working across layers of a product
• A bias toward action and iteration over waiting for perfect clarity
• Comfort operating in ambiguity and evolving systems over time
• The ability to make reasonable tradeoffs between speed and correctness
• Emotional maturity when plans change or decisions shift
• Curiosity and openness to learning new tools, patterns, and technologies
• A collaborative mindset and willingness to step outside a narrow scope

Experience level can vary. What matters most is how you operate, not how many years you have used a specific technology.


This role is likely a good fit if you

• Enjoy fast paced environments where the product is still taking shape
• Like building real systems that people depend on
• Are comfortable learning as you go and adapting as requirements evolve
• Can stay grounded and productive when things are imperfect or changing
• Want meaningful ownership and impact rather than rigid boundaries

This environment is demanding at times. There are periods of intensity as the platform grows and customer needs accelerate. It is also deeply rewarding for people who enjoy momentum, ownership, and shaping something real while it is still being formed.

This team cares as much about whether this environment will bring out your best work as they do about technical capability.
