## Company Overview

Stell Engineering, Inc. ("Stell"), established in 2022 by seasoned aerospace industry veterans, is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. They build secure requirements management software for mission-critical systems in highly regulated industries (aerospace, defense, national security). The platform transforms static technical documentation into actionable, collaborative workflows. Founded on the principle that next-generation engineering tools should be powerful, collaborative, and user-friendly.

## What They Build

Stell is a web application — a word processor purpose-built for engineers, seamlessly connected to development and compliance data. It replaces legacy tools (JAMA Software, Polarion) and manual workarounds (Excel, Word, Jira, Confluence).

### Core Product Features

- **Dual-View System (Document + Matrix)**: Toggle between original documents and a dynamic compliance matrix. Document view for ingesting/writing headings, descriptions, and requirements (with images and tables). Matrix view for linking parent/child requirements across documents, attaching verification artifacts, and tracking metadata.
- **PDF Import (AI-Powered)**: Instant conversion of PDF, Word, or Excel files into interactive compliance matrices using AI. No other requirements management tool on the market can automatically import and digitize PDF specifications.
- **Cross-Standard Search**: Rapid identification of key phrases across specifications, standards libraries, manuals, and statements of work. Automatically highlights every requirement and links standards.
- **Verification & Validation Tracking**: Catalog research and test efforts, link evidence files to requirements.
- **Graphical Views**: Map how requirements are connected within systems and across programs.
- **Traceability**: Full change history — understand in detail how requirements have evolved over time. Parent-child linking and verification evidence tracking.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Comment and Change Request features with comprehensive permissioning. Entire engineering team stays on the same page.
- **Supplier Sharing Portal**: Share compliance matrices with customers and suppliers — no more emails, phone calls, or long meetings.
- **Search & Knowledge Database**: Powerful search using keywords, tags, filtering, and sorting. Build deep databases of engineering knowledge across all specifications and documents.
- **MBSE Support**: Dual document + spreadsheet UI, AI tagging, graphical relationship views, and parametric modeling.
- **Audit Trail**: Preserves audit trail of all actions and changes within a single compliant platform.

## Target Industries

- Aerospace & Defense
- Government / DoD programs
- National security
- Any highly-complex, regulated sector requiring rigorous requirements traceability

## Security & Compliance

Stell's AI runs entirely on **AWS GovCloud** with no external model calls — all prompts and embeddings remain within Stell's authorization boundary. AI is never outsourced.

### Certifications & Frameworks

- **SOC 2 Type II** certified (achieved Dec 2024)
- **NIST 800-171 / CMMC** compliant
- **FedRAMP / NIST 800-53** aligned
- **ITAR-Controlled Data Handling**
- **IL5 ATO** under U.S. Space Force sponsorship
- Supports **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)** handling per DoD/NIST standards
- Supports classified & self-hosted deployments

### Security Architecture

- **Access Control**: Role-based, granular permissions enforcing least privilege
- **Encryption**: FIPS 140-2 validated encryption (data in transit and at rest), HSM for cryptographic key management
- **Testing**: Continuous vulnerability scanning, automated security testing, annual penetration tests
- **Governance**: Background-checked team members, NIST 800-53/171-aligned incident response and change-control processes

## Government Contracts & Milestones

- **SBIR Phase 2 Contract** with U.S. Space Force (announced Feb 2024)
- **Space RCO Contract** to deploy software for rapid systems integration (Nov 2025) — expanding work with USSF to strengthen system integration, cybersecurity, and engineering speed
- Actively partnered with **Space Systems Command (SSC)** to accelerate mission assurance
- Featured at **DIU** (Defense Innovation Unit)
- Featured in **TechCrunch** (Jan 2023)
- **Preseed raise** announced Jan 2023
- **Seed raise** completed Mar 2024

## Compliance Standards They Help Navigate

## AI Engineer Role Requirements

### Must-Have

- US citizen or green card holder (ITAR restriction)
- 5+ years professional software development experience
- Experience building and scaling distributed systems
- Track record shipping enterprise-grade web apps (high concurrency/availability)
- Proficiency in a modern frontend framework like React (component optimization, performance tuning)
- Experience with architectural principles like Domain-Driven Design
- Strong understanding of cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Excellent communication skills and collaborative, product-focused mindset
- Willingness to be on-site 3 days/week in LA or SF

### Nice-to-Have

- Machine learning / AI experience — model integration, LLM APIs (OpenAI, Claude), embeddings, RAG pipelines, or ML inference infrastructure
- ML infrastructure — model serving, vector databases, data pipelines, feature stores, or MLOps tooling
- AWS GovCloud and compliance frameworks (FedRAMP/NIST)
- Infrastructure as Code, particularly Terraform
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Early-stage startup experience

### Compensation

- $170-$200k base salary + equity
- Healthcare, vision, dental

### Key Responsibilities

- Full-stack work (databases, APIs, client code, cloud infra)
- Building and integrating AI/ML features into the product (e.g., document understanding, intelligent linking, contract analysis)
- Collaborating with CEO/Head of Engineering on architecture and roadmaps
- Building secure solutions for aerospace & defense clients
- Mentoring through architecture, design, and code reviews
- Proof-of-concept work to evaluate new technologies, especially AI/ML approaches

The role leans heavily toward someone who can operate as a senior generalist with AI chops in a small team — comfortable across the stack, security-conscious, and ready to shape technical direction at an early-stage company. Given Stell's focus on documentation and contract compliance, expect AI work to center around document processing, NLP, and intelligent automation rather than traditional ML modeling.



I've learned more about The engineering role: it's an AI engineering role, but it's more full stack based, and it's essentially what I already do. I'm working as a full stack engineer and also making features and bringing new AI tools and studying new AI tools.
