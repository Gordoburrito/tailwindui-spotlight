We built Zelda, an AI assistant specifically for requirements management. Join us on December 2nd for a live webinar where we'll discuss how we built it and show you how it helps aerospace and hardware engineering teams work faster with complex specifications.

What you'll see:
→ Why we built Zelda: The vision and our commitment to AI security and privacy
→ How we built it: Our technical approach, what makes Zelda different from generic AI tools, and how we designed for aerospace/defense workflows
→ Live demo: Watch Zelda navigate specs, answer questions, and create requirement links
→ Q&A: Ask our engineering team anything!

Beyond ChatGPT, Zelda:
• Has context of your entire project—all specs, requirements, and documents
• Can take action on your behalf, saving you and your team time
• Lives inside Stell, so no more copying and pasting between tools

Tuesday, December 2 | 11am PT / 2pm ET
Register: https://lnkd.in/gi5ywNYt

Whether you're currently using Stell, evaluating requirements management tools, or just curious about AI in engineering, this webinar is for you. We’re looking forward to seeing you!… more

Today, we're launching Beyond Memory — a campaign close to our hearts that we hope will change how people understand dementia, especially rarer types like frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

Here's what many people don't know: dementia doesn't always look like memory loss. It doesn't always affect older adults. Sometimes it shows up as changes in how someone speaks, acts, or relates to the world around them. And too often, families find themselves confused, searching for answers, or facing misdiagnoses.

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone.

Millions of adults across the U.S. are living with conditions like FTD and other rarer forms of dementia. Yet these symptoms are frequently misunderstood or overlooked entirely — leaving families isolated when they need support the most.

We believe everyone deserves to understand what they're facing and where to turn for help. That's why we're partnering with incredible organizations like Purpose, The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD), Lewy Body Dementia Association, Milken Institute Strategic Philanthropy, and Roon to share real stories from families and caregivers, clear up misconceptions, and help people recognize early signs.

This #FTDAwarenessWeek and beyond, let's keep these conversations going. Because when we break down stigma and share knowledge, we help more people find the care, community, and hope they deserve.

Shoutout to amazing work across the space of dementia and brain health:
I AM ALS, Alzheimer's Association®, CureGRN, Cure MAPT FTD, For Their Thoughts Foundation, Genetic ALS & FTD: End the Legacy, The Bluefield Project to Cure Frontotemporal Dementia, The Rainwater Charitable Foundation, The 10,000 Brains Project, Dana Foundation, Next50, Milken Institute, AARP, Emma Heming Willis, Helen Bundy Medsger, Sekhar Paladugu, Dr. Bashir Raheem Easter

We believe that sustained funding for early-stage research in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) will be key to advancing potential treatments and offering hope to families like ours who are affected by this disease. 

In partnership with the Milken Institute Science Philanthropy Accelerator for Research and Collaboration (SPARC), we congratulate the second cohort of our FTD Grant Program’s funded researchers, and we invite new researchers to apply to our next round of funding for this critical area of research. … more

I am hiring a Forward Deployed Aerospace Engineer at Stell to work directly with our customers to help them deliver their projects. LA or SF - in person only!

https://lnkd.in/gQxbE_xz

Honestly, the role title is aerospace engineer but we could have just as easily called it customer success. Because for us all that matters is that our customers can build and deliver their products better and faster. We believe software should speed them up on the tedious bits (technical compliance tracking, maintaining a detailed systems model)

If you want to be solving problems with our customers who are building batteries, satellites, launch vehicles, and martime systems - then this role is for you
