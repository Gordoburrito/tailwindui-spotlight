Wrapping up 3+ wonderful years working at LinkedIn. I don't have enough words to express how grateful I am for all that I learned, everyone I met, and everything we built. Thank you to everyone I worked with, you all are truly the best. 

I'm super excited to begin my next chapter working towards a masters degree at University of California, Berkeley! 

Special thanks to Cara Kessler - who was never technically my boss but loves to tell everyone she was. There is no better mentor or friend. And to Doug Guastaferro who actually is my boss - thank you for being such a thoughtful leader and strong advocate, our team would have been lost without you this past year.

Capt. Sully Sullenberger is known as an American Hero after saving 155 lives and averting what could have been a fatal disaster. 

But before flying commercial airliners and receiving a movie deal based off of his courageous Hudson River landing, Sully was a pilot for the Air Force.

He spoke with LinkedIn’s Daniel Roth about veterans transitioning to civilian life, operating with new and unfamiliar teams and procedures, and finding effective uses for military expertise in the civilian world. He says, “having someone with a military background is a huge resource in so many ways” for employers.

Leaving LinkedIn today after three months of work as a software engineering intern on the Content Creation team. I feel so lucky to have had the opportunity to meet so many smart and talented people, like my amazing managers Doug Guastaferro and Jenie Gao, coworkers Afif Antabli, Justin Peterman, Erek Gokturk, Lisamarie Kelly, Matthew Schouest, De-Wei Kung, John Lau, and Bow Archer. 

The biggest shout out goes to my super incredible mentor Allison Yamamoto. I'll never forget the hours we spent coding early in the morning and late at night, the life talks that got me through a challenging project, and our daily escapes to get freeze. Getting to work with her for twelve weeks was the best part of my summer, and I'm so glad they stuck us together! 

Thank you to everyone at LinkedIn, and I'm excited to see you all again soon!

Happy Mentor Day ✨ Here's to my amazing mentor, Allison Yamamoto! 

Thank you for the daily code reviews, the big life talks, the laughs, and for truly caring about my engineering and career development. I'm so lucky to get to work with you, and I don't say it enough. 

Trying to tackle a new framework, codebase, and build out a feature at a huge tech company in twelve weeks is definitely intimidating, but having a great mentor by your side (literally 3 feet away), makes it a lot easier. 

Thank you for everything Allison, you're the best!
