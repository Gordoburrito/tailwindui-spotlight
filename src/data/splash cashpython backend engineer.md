Job Description: -

About Client:-
We're building a consumer finance app for emerging markets, in
partnership with
extremely large distribution partners. We are creating a joint virtual
banking and
cryptocurrency wallet that allows users all over the world to move
seamlessly within our
financial ecosystem.
Why now: stable coins are changing cross-border payments. There is an
opportunity to
rebuild financial infrastructure for the 3 billion people who need
better financial rails.
We're a small, senior-only team moving fast. We are well-funded with the
ability to
offer high cash compensation, based in SF, and led by proven founders
with
successful exits. Every hire shapes our product direction while we make
Day 1 impact on
global financial inclusion.

The Role: -
A Technical Lead on our team is a hands-on leadership role for
candidates with breadth across multiple layers of our stack and the
judgment to drive technical outcomes. We are building:

  ●  An iOS app (Swift)
  ●  An Android app (Kotlin)
  ●  A Web app (React)
  ●  A standalone backend (Python + FastAPI, Postgres, AWS)

If you bring a mix of these skill sets and can guide others to deliver
high-quality software, this role may be a strong fit. Please also review
our Senior Android/iOS/Frontend/Backend roles for deeper,
discipline-specific details.

As an early engineering leader, you will define our architecture, set
engineering standards, and lead the delivery of a performant, reliable,
and secure product from the ground up. The problem space includes
financial services with real-money movement at international scale and
non-trivial compliance, integrity, and latency constraints. You will
collaborate across product, design, and operations, and help grow and
mentor the team. You will work directly with the founders. This role may
expand to broader engineering leadership across platforms as we scale.

Requirements

  ● 7-10 years building and shipping consumer-facing mobile and/or web
applications   with meaningful full‑stack exposure (e.g.,
React/TypeScript, Python, Go/Rust, Postgres, AWS, modern CI/CD).
  ● Demonstrated experience managing technical teams, making
architectural decisions, and mentoring engineers.
